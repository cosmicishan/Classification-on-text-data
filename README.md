Hello, Universe!

I have done a text classification project where models predict the job of a person through the job description with 3 different machine learning algorithms SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. I used 5 different techniques to convert text into a vector which is: Bag of words, Unigram-Bigram TF-IDF, Average word2vec, and TF-IDF word2vec. The best accuracy I get is the 67% TF_IDf model on the SVM algorithm. 

The code I used for Text Processing and Techniques to turn a sentence into a vector is taken from the following notebook written by Srikanth Varma from Applied AI course implemented on Amazon food review dataset: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FCQfzaYb-yyDIuF5RKTFa0VPnsYJZyR8
