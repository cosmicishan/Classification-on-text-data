Hello, Universe!

I done text classification project where model predict the job of a person through job decsription with 3 different machine learning algorithms SVM, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. I used 5 different technqiues to convert text into a vector which is : Bag of words, Unigram-Bigram TF-IDF, Average word2vec and TF-Idf word2vec. The best accuracy I get is 67% TF_IDf model on SVM algorithm.
