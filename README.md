Hello, Universe!

I done text classification project where model predict the job of a person through job decsription with 3 different machine learning algorithms SVM, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. I used 5 different technqiues to convert text into a vector which is : Bag of words, Unigram-Bigram TF-IDF, Average word2vec and TF-Idf word2vec. The best accuracy I get is 67% TF_IDf model on SVM algorithm. 

The code I used for Text Processing and Techniques to turn sentence into vector is taken from this following notebook written by Srikanth Varma from Applied AI course implemented on Amazon food review dataset : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FCQfzaYb-yyDIuF5RKTFa0VPnsYJZyR8
